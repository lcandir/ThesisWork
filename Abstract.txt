Electrical machines have been widely used in almost all moving elements of industrial, automotive, military and aerospace systems. Increasing utilization of electrical machines results in an increasing demand of high relaibility and safety. Especially in mission critical applications, unexpected failures of these machines may bring irrecoverable damages to the systems. Furthermore, such failures may be hazardous to human life in military or aerospace applications. One method to meet the reliability and safety requirement is increasing the systems' redundancy. For this purpose, the systems are designed to have extra modules to be used in case of an emergency. Although inreasing redundancy is a solution to the reliability problem, it has drawbacks. Adding extra modules as substitutes increases overall cost, volume and complexity of the system. A better solution can be monitoring the machine's condition continuously or running a test on the machine periodically to predict the failure before it causes a fatal damage to the system or human health. In this thesis, characteristics of possible machine faults are described. Methods for condition monitoring and fault detection are proposed. Different signal processing techniques are analyzed. Theoretical propositions are validated on a test setup. The results are examined to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methods and possible further improvements are declared as future work.
