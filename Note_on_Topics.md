## General appraoch:

- Theoretical claims
- Simulation
- Hardware implementation and controlled experiments

## Condition monitoring techniques

- **Motor Current Signature Analysis (MCSA)**
	- Faults create specific harmonics
	- Extracting data from current harmonics (which faults can be detected?)
	- Can be implemented on an existing motor drive.
	- Code optimization is needed.
	
## Control and signal processing techniques

- **Modal pedictive control (MPC)**
	- Which estimation techniques does it utilize?
